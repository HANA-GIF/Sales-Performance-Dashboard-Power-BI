# Sales-Performance-Dashboard-Power-BI

🚀 Overview
This project is a complete Sales Performance Dashboard built using Power BI, based on real-world scenarios. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of a company's sales data, enabling insights into performance by region, product, customer segment, and more.
